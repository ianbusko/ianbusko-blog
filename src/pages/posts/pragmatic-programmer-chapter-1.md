This week I started reading The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. It's a classic: I regret waiting this long to start.

The point of this book is to describe practices that will make you a better programmer. It almost never delves into technical details. Rather than summarizing entire chapters, I'm going to post notes of what stuck out to me from a few of the chapters. There aren't the main points or even the most important points. There's a ton of material, so read the book if you're even considering it.

Here are my notes from Chapter 1.

## Provide Options, Don't make Lame Excuses ##
A large part of Chapter 1 talks about taking responsibility for your work. This premise of this section is to not just say that you can't solve a problem. Instead, take the time to understand why the way that you're approaching it doesn't work. Play out the conversation that you're going to have with the other person in your head. Talk to a rubber duck if you have to. Then, after you understand how the conversation will sound, think of some better options. You might solve the problem yourself, or you might have a list of better discussion points to take to your boss or coworker.

## Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs ##
This was my personal favorite section in the chapter. There are two related concepts in taking ownership of a particular problem.

The Stone Soup scenario is a situation where you know a good way to solve the problem at hand but your solution will be met with blank stares from the people who can authorize that decision. You have to find ways to get progressive buy-in: show the value in your solution without trying to sell the whole thing.

In my workplace, we did this to get buy-in for a CSS framework. At first it was hard to get buy-in because of the resources involved (server to host, developer time to maintain, etc). A few developers used the framework in a project that they were working on (a low-impact scenario), then presented the framework to the directors. One director found that he was able to build a new page in a low amount of time compared to the existing tools, so he bought in. We were then able to get dedicated server space and developer time to support using the framework. It took progressively large steps to get there.

The other scenario in this chapter is the Boiled Frog. In this scenario, you as the developer are ignoring the bigger picture and you may be working against it. Instead of making things better, you may be making things worse for yourself or others. Remember, you are a part of a team and an organization.

## Communication ##
This section had numerous valuable subsections that will benefit developers of any level of experience. There were two that stuck out to me because of some recent events.

The first point that resonated with me was the importance of knowing your audience. It's easy to know what you want out of a situation. It's less obvious what the other person wants. The authors suggest using the `WISDOM` acrostic to figure out what is important:
* What do you want them to learn?
* What is their interest in what you've got to say?
* How sophisticated are they?
* How much detail do they want?
* Whom do you want to own the information?
* How can you motivate them to listen to you?

In the above example of adopting our CSS framework, determining who the stakeholders were and what they needed to hear was key. To help, I asked a couple of people I knew what was important to each of the directors. That helped us to steer the conversation in a way that met everyone's needs and concerns.

The other point that I found valuable in this chapter was to get back to people. This seems obvious. In a work situation recently, I didn't realize how well one of my team members kept constant communication between developers and managers until he switched to another project. Suddenly I realized how much information I assumed was being handled by someone else. Without his careful attention, project managers were left asking for status updates in public Slack channels.
